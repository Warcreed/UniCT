    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Introduction</h3>

    <p><em>Karnaugh maps solver</em> is a web app that takes the truth table of a function as input,
        transposes it onto the respective Karnaugh map and finds the minimum forms SOP and POS according to the
        visual resolution method by Maurice Karnaugh, American physicist and mathematician.</p>
    <p>The program is presented as a web app, therefore executable on most of the internet browsers.</p>
    <p>For more information, check the <a href="Installation-en.html" target="_blank">Installation Notes</a> file.</p>

    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Interface and utilization</h3>
    <p>The software interface consists of a single main screen, in which all actions can be performed.</p>
    <p>It is divided into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Truth table, where it is possible, for each row, assign a value between 0, 1 and X, which will be reported
            on the map.</li>
        <li>Map of Karnaugh, where for each cell, it is possible to modify the internal values between 0, 1 and X,
            synchronously with the truth table.
            It will display the groups formed by the calculation of the solution.</li>
        <li>Selection menu, where you can choose which type of map to display (2, 3 or 4 variables), choose between SOP
            and POS form, fill the entire map with 0, 1 or X,
            process the solution according to the chosen criteria.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the page the solution will appear, identified by the colored groups that are the same of
            group colors in the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Program functioning</h3>
    <p>It is possible to select to assign the values between 0, 1 and X to every single combination of input both in
        the truth table and on the map.
        The table and the map will be synchronized, so that the user is free to choose his own method of input.</p>
    <br><img src="html/img/1.jpg" alt="The image shows the synchronized table and map"><br><br>
    <p>You can click the button <strong>Elabora</strong> when the criteria are set in the setup menu on the right side
        of the page.</p>
    <br><img src="html/img/2.jpg" alt="The image shows the menu of choice"><br><br>
    <p>The solution will be obtained divided into colored groups, that identifies the solution for each corresponding
        group drawn on the map.</p>
